Sharing your feelings can help you process them. \n- **Engage in Self-Care**: Focus on activities that make you feel good, whether it's exercising, reading, or spending time in nature. \n- **Reflect on the Relationship**: Consider what you learned from the relationship and how you can grow from this experience. \n- **Give It Time**: Healing takes time, so be patient with yourself. \n\nRemember, it's okay to seek professional help if you're feeling overwhelmed.",
